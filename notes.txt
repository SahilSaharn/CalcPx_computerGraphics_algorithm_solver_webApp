                                            PROBLEMS

[Problem : 1]

sometimes our custom components have tough time styling coz tailwind scan the document and then add the styling and it done ,

but i  case of custom components which we have created using javascript thier  defined markup is added later and not scanned and ,hence not scanned so no  styling so always ,
 - add your custom components .js file to tailwind config file so it can scan its markup and generate styles for it
